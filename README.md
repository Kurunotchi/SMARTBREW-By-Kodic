# SMARTBREW-By-Kodic
SMARTBREW_KODIC
This is the code for SmartBrew: The autonomous coffee maker using IOT.

I am Kurunotchi taking a Bachelor of Science in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Fullbright College.

This is the project for engineering robotics and I am trying to connect it to Internet using ESP8266/Wemos D1 R2, but this Code is running in Arduino Uno and when I uploaded it into my Wemos D1 R2 board, it didn't work. Yes, I remove that single line in the ESP8266 library and other that are connected to the code of ESP8266 library.

This project has two different Microcontroller, I'm using Wemos D1 R2 for Master and for the Slave is Arduino Uno. My Wemos D1 R2 is Connected to the Internet, so that if they want to drink a Coffee they can choose their Coffee through Mobile phone or PC and other than that. I added Servo Motor to Wemos D1 R2 pins that I'm going to use as coffee dropper, LCD for the display when they trying to choose their kind of Coffee without using a Mobile phone or pc. And our Slave or Arduino uno, for sensors and other actuators like Stepper Motor and Dc Motor.

I'm still working on this Code and I will add another code for this project if my components are completed.
